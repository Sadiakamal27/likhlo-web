## Likhlo - New way to Publish Books

Traditionally books were written in a way that to change them you have to stop the whole press and then re publish all the books again and name them as a new edition. This would take people, time, money and a lot of effort to just add a chapter at the end.

Well, now it ends. On Likhlo, anyone can publish any book and make changes any time and let the users pay if they want to see the changes.

I would love to think it like this that we are changing the book publishing industry.

### How does it work?

1. Create an account
2. Go to write page
3. start writing by adding a content block
4. when finished, publish the book and vallah!
